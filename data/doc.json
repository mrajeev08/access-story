{"one":"Rabies is a devastating disease that causes an estimated 60,000 human deaths across the world. Once a person starts showing symptoms of rabies infection, there is no treatment and death is almost always inevitable. These deaths are entirely preventable, however. If an exposed person is vaccinated promptly after exposure, the risk of death is very low. In addition, over 99% of human deaths occur from exposure to a rabies infected domestic dog. Mass vaccination of dogs has been shown to be effective at preventing human deaths, and can even lead to elimination of the disease in the dog population.","two":"In fact, many countries in North America and Western Europe have achieved elimination of canine rabies programs through mass dog vaccination. Currently, the burden of human rabies is concentrated in low-and-middle income countries with generally lower investment in both post-exposure prophylaxis and dog vaccination.","three":"We will zoom in to Madagascar, a large island nation off the coast of the African coast. The people of Madagascar face many public health challenges, and canine rabies is one of them. Thought to have been introduced to the island by the French colonials, rabies has been circulating endemically on the island for over a century.","four":"Currently, the Insitut Pasteur de Madagascar provides post-exposure vaccines to 31 clinics that provision the vaccine at no cost to patients. This means that access to the vaccine is highly geographically restricted, but it is hard to tease the impact of this access on burden, as the places with low access to PEP are the same places that have poor surveillance for the disease. Or in other words, if a person lives > 3 hours away from a clinic, you are more likely to not receive the life saving rabies vaccine putting them at a higher risk of death, but if a death occurs there it’s less likely to get reported or documented.","five":"We use data on travel times to the closest clinic provisioning post-exposure vaccine and on numbers of patients seeking the vaccine across the country to estimate the impact that limited geographic access to PEP has on health care seeking behavior and the burden of human rabies deaths.","six":"We do this by…","seven":"and then….","eight":"and then…","nine":"We find that the proportion of people who are exposed to rabies that seek PEP are much lower by travel times","ten":"We can also explore what happens when we expand access","eleven":"using some more simulation we can translate this to deaths. PEP is currently very effective and expanding access can reduce deaths but only up to a certain point","twelve":"why is that?","thirteen":"variance not explained by travel time. list some reasons/","fourteen":"landscape of access in Madagascar (and point to discrepancies from the accessibility studies)","fifteen":"# of people vs. risk. marginalized communities.","sixteen":"equity and conclusion","methods":[{"type":"text","value":"I can type freely the methods."},{"type":"text","value":"Over multiple paragraphs."},{"type":"text","value":"It should work fine."}]}
